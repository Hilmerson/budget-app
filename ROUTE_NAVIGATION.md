# Route-Based Navigation Implementation

This document outlines the route-based navigation implementation in the Budget App, which replaces the previous hash-based approach.

## Overview

The app now uses Next.js's built-in routing system to navigate between different sections of the dashboard. This provides several benefits:

- Clean, semantic URLs (e.g. `/dashboard/expenses` instead of `/dashboard#expenses`)
- Better SEO as each section gets a proper URL
- Better analytics tracking
- Follows web standards and conventions

## Structure

- `/dashboard` - Main dashboard
- `/dashboard/income` - Income management
- `/dashboard/expenses` - Expense management
- `/dashboard/achievements` - User achievements
- `/profile` - User profile

## Components

### DashboardLayout

Located at `src/app/dashboard/layout.tsx`, this is a server component that:
- Checks authentication
- Provides the structure shared by all dashboard pages
- Dynamically loads client components as needed

### DashboardSidebar

Located at `src/components/DashboardSidebar.tsx`, this client component:
- Shows navigation links for all sections
- Displays user info and profile picture
- Shows the level progress bar
- Provides sign-out functionality

### Client-Side State Management

The XP gain animation and other client-side state is managed through:
- `ClientWrapper` component containing animations
- Zustand store for state persistence

## Migrating From Hash-Based Navigation

For backward compatibility, the old `Dashboard` component still exists but redirects to the new routes based on the hash fragment. If a user visits a URL with a hash like `/dashboard#expenses`, they will be automatically redirected to `/dashboard/expenses`.

## Adding New Sections

To add a new dashboard section:

1. Create a new page file at `src/app/dashboard/your-section/page.tsx`
2. Add the section to the sidebar items array in `DashboardSidebar.tsx`
3. Add a condition to `getActiveSectionFromPath` in `DashboardSidebar.tsx`

## Future Improvements

- Add page metadata for better SEO
- Implement proper error boundaries for each route
- Create more specialized layouts for specific sections
- Add route-based data prefetching
